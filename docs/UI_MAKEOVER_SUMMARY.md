## Icon Work Summary

- **Commit:** `bf48265` — "Replace app icons with new blue icon pack"
- New launcher icon (three blue diagonal bars, cyan→sky→royal blue gradient)
- New adaptive icon foreground (512×512 playstore version)

## Docs Cleanup Summary

- **Commit:** `5b3d67a` — "Consolidate project documentation"
- **Commit:** `5667458` — "Ignore archived documentation snapshots"
- 9 stale markdown docs moved to `docs/archive/` (local-only, gitignored)
- 4 new consolidated docs created: `DEVELOPMENT.md`, `BUILD_AND_RELEASE.md`, `GARMIN_COMPANION.md`, `DOCS_INDEX.md`
- `README.md` trimmed and updated with new docs references
- `docs/UI_MAKEOVER_PLAN.md` created with full migration plan
- `docs/REPO_AUDIT_BEFORE_UI_MAKEOVER.md` from Phase 1

## Dark-Only Decision

The app is now dark-only. `userInterfaceStyle: "dark"` in `app.json`. The theme provider forces `isDark: true` and `colors.light` mirrors `colors.dark` for backward compatibility. The App Dark Mode toggle was removed from SettingsScreen (`74206e6`). Map Dark Mode toggle remains and works normally.

## Final Palette

| Token | Hex | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `bg` / `background` | `#0D0D0D` | App background |
| `surface` / `cardBg` | `#1A1A1A` | Cards, tab bar, modals |
| `surfaceElevated` | `#242424` | Elevated surfaces |
| `text` | `#E0E0E0` | Primary text |
| `textSecondary` / `textDim` | `#888888` | Secondary/muted text |
| `accent` / `primary` / `iconActive` | `#4FC3F7` | Active states, highlights, icons |
| `accentGlow` | `rgba(79,195,247,0.3)` | Glow effects |
| `border` | `#2A2A2A` | Hairline borders |
| `danger` | `#EF5350` | Destructive actions |
| `warning` / `pauseButton` | `#FF9800` | Pause, caution |
| `success` (semantic) | `#4CAF50` | GPS active, tracking, success only |
| `gold` | `#FFD700` | Achievements |
| `silver` | `#C0C0C0` | Achievements |
| `bronze` | `#CD7F32` | Achievements |
| `xp` | `#CE93D8` | XP/gamification |

Splash/icon background: `#0D1117` (slightly navy for icon contrast — intentional).

## Screens Migrated

| Screen | Commit | Changes |
|---|---|---|
| App shell (App.js) | `0c5d9fb` | Header, tab bar, status bar, loading screen restyled. Green LinearGradient header removed. Dark bg + hairline borders. |
| StatsScreen | `bc2ce70` | Progress buttons → `theme.accent`, XP bg opacity reduced, section title letter-spacing 0.5, borders → `#2A2A2A` hairline |
| ActivityDetailScreen | `bc2ce70` | Border colour → `#2A2A2A` |
| CalendarScreen | `bc2ce70` | Border colour → `#2A2A2A` |
| SettingsScreen | `54af495`, `74206e6`, `5a87157` | 23 hardcoded colours → theme tokens. Dark mode toggle removed. 7 inline icons → shared imports. |
| TrackingScreen | `5a87157`, `4faa359`, `91251fa` | 5 inline icons → shared imports. 5 hardcoded colours → theme tokens. Stat boxes + controls container get hairline borders. Modal radius 20→24. |

## TrackingScreen Changes

- **Icons consolidated:** RecenterIcon, PauseIcon, CheckIcon, CacheSuccessIcon, TrashIcon moved to `components/Icons.js`
- **Colours migrated:** notification colour `#4CAF50` → `theme.accent`, modal button `#2196F3` → `theme.accent`, CacheSuccessIcon `#2196F3` → `theme.accent`, warning bg `#FFF3E0` → `rgba(255,152,0,0.1)`, RecenterIcon `#FF9800` → `theme.warning`
- **Visual polish:** Stat boxes get hairline border, controls container gets hairline top border, modal content radius 20→24
- **Shared components:** Assessed but not forced — modals have specialized multi-button layouts, stat boxes use vertical layout (not horizontal like `StatRow`)

## Known Intentional Exceptions

1. **Activity-type colours** — `#1976D2` (walking=blue), `#D32F2F` (biking=red) are hardcoded in TrackingScreen, CalendarScreen, and ActivityDetailScreen. These are semantic, not brand colours.
2. **Google Maps colours** — `#4285F4` (blue marker), `#4CAF50` (green start marker) are Google Maps API defaults in TrackingScreen.
3. **Map Dark Mode toggle** — still valid and functional in SettingsScreen. Controls map tile style only, not app theme.
4. **npm vulnerabilities** — 46 vulnerabilities (2 critical, 20 high, 22 moderate, 2 low) are pre-existing. Not caused by UI work, not fixed in this pass.
5. **Shared UI components** — `AppScreen`, `Card`, `SectionHeader`, `StatRow`, `EmptyState`, `Modal` are available in `src/components/ui/` but not yet adopted by any screen. Available for future deeper refactors.

## Validation Performed

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `node -c` syntax check (18 JS files) | ✅ All pass |
| `app.json` JSON validation | ✅ Valid JSON |
| `npm install` | ✅ Exit 0, 1188 packages |
| `npx expo start` (Metro bundler) | ✅ Starts successfully (pre-existing version warnings unchanged) |
| Visual QA via code inspection | ✅ All checklist items pass |
| APK build | Not run (EAS cloud build required, not practical in this session) |
| Screenshots | Not captured (no emulator/device available in this session) |

## Remaining Follow-Up Candidates

1. **npm audit/vulnerability pass** — 46 pre-existing vulnerabilities should be addressed separately with `npm audit fix`
2. **Shared component adoption decision** — Decide whether unused `src/components/ui/*` components should be adopted into screens or trimmed. They're available for future refactors but add dead code if never used.
3. **APK/release build process** — Use `eas build --platform android --profile preview` to produce a test APK. The build pipeline is documented in `docs/BUILD_AND_RELEASE.md`.
4. **Deeper component refactor** — Only if future UI work needs it. The current theme system flows through all screens via `theme.*` props, so the visual language is consistent without forcing structural changes.
5. **Root-level doc consolidation** — 10 root `.md` files were archived in Phase 2A. If any are confirmed stale, they can be deleted from `docs/archive/`.
6. **Activity-type colour extraction** — `#1976D2`/`#D32F2F` could be promoted to theme tokens (`theme.walkingType` / `theme.bikingType`) for consistency, but this is a minor refactor.

---

**Branch ready for test APK:** ✅ Yes. All syntax checks pass, Metro bundler starts, theme is consistent across all screens. An EAS build (`eas build --platform android --profile preview`) should produce a working APK for on-device visual QA.
