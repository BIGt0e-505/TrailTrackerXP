# Development Guide

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v16+
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **Expo CLI** (install globally: `npm install -g expo-cli`)
- **Expo Go** app on your Android phone (for dev testing) — available from Google Play Store
- **Android device** for testing (emulator or physical phone)

## Getting Started

```bash
cd TrailTrackerXP
npm install
npx expo start          # Opens Expo DevTools with QR code
```

Open Expo Go on your phone, scan the QR code, and grant location permissions.

> **Note:** For background location to work, go to Android Settings → Apps → Expo Go → Permissions → Location → "Allow all the time".

## Data Storage Architecture

The app uses a dual storage system:

### AsyncStorage (cache)
- Fast access for daily use
- Stores activity metadata, settings, gamification state
- Key prefix: `@trail_tracker_*`

### File System (persistent)
- Each activity saved as an individual GPX 1.1 file in `documentDirectory/activities/`
- Gamification state in `documentDirectory/activities/gamification.json`
- Export backups in `documentDirectory/export/`
- GPX files are compatible with Strava, Garmin Connect, and other fitness apps

### Recovery
If cache data is lost or corrupted:
1. Settings → Data Storage → **Recover from GPX Files** to restore from the persistent GPX files
2. Settings → Data Storage → **Save to GPX Files** to persist any cache-only activities

## Importing from Strava

1. Go to Strava.com → Settings → My Account → "Download or Delete Your Account" → "Get Started" → "Request Your Archive"
2. Wait for the email, download and unzip the export
3. Settings → Data Storage → **Import from Strava**
4. Select `.gpx` files from the export's `activities/` folder
5. (Optional) Add `activities.csv` for better metadata
6. Activities are classified as Walk/Ride based on GPX type

## Path Overlay Feature (Walking Mode)

When activity type is Walking, the app can overlay OpenStreetMap tiles showing footpaths, bridleways, and trails at 70% opacity. Toggle via the "🗺️ Paths" button on the tracking screen.

- Tile source: `https://tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png`
- Uses `UrlTile` from react-native-maps
- Only shown for walking (disabled for biking to reduce clutter)
- Free, no API key required, good UK footpath coverage
